          <p class="card-desc">Tulum is situated on the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. It once served as the
            major port of the Mayan city of Coba. Tulum was built around 1200 AD when the
            Mayan civilization was already in decline and therefore lacks the elegance of some
            other famous sites. The tropical beach backdrop however makes this a stunning
            top attraction which should not be missed. Accommodation can range from simple
            cabanas to 5 star luxury resorts.</p>

          <p class="card-desc">El Arco is an incredible arch found in Cabo San Lucas. This unique rock
            formation marks the spot where the Pacific Ocean becomes the Gulf of
            California. The arch has become an icon of Cabo San Lucas, and it can be
            viewed from several angles. A stroll along the beach gives the opportunity for
            amazing pictures of El Arco, not to mention views of the blue waters, the gray
            whales that frequently frolic in the ocean and additional rock formations
            along the coastline.</p>
